  <li><b>Binary slot tree prototype</b>
    <p>This is a new approach where a tree of slots is maintained.
      The elements are assigned to locked slots in this tree,
      except for the visible elements.
      These are temporarily assigned to the special visible-slot.
      This slot is inserted into the tree adjacent to a locked slot
      and all of its ancestors are unlocked.
      When we want to make a different set of elements visible,
      we reassign all the elements back to their "natural" locked slots,
      move the visible slot to the right place in the tree
      and assign the newly visible elements to it,
      unlocking all of it's current ancestors
      (and relocking it's previous ancestors).
      <b>This is not scroller</b>, it's a proof-of-concept for benchmarking.
      It cannot handle updates
      and does not manage spacer divs above/below the unlocked content.
      It simply cycles through groups of elements,
      revealing chunks of 10 as fast as frame rate allows.</p>

    <p>Particularly interesting are 3 things that seem unexpectedly slow.
      They all seem like O(n) effects that we should fix.
      <ul>
        <li>insertBefore (used to move the visible slot from one location to another)
          seems very expensive given that we are just moving it around a tree
        <li>slot.assignedNodes() seems very expensive given that it returns 10 elements in these demos.
          It appears to go as O(n) in the number of children of element,
          not the number of nodes assigned to this slot.
        <li>Recalc style seems slow, 15ms for 43 elements (in the 100K case).
          Something is over-invalidating?
          Or maybe we can tweak the styles of the custom elements.

    <li>100K elements under a counter - the counter is in a fixed-size
      DIV but changing the content incurs a massive cost from the 100K
      elements below it even if they are in a scroller with strict
      containment (some scenarios are better than others). This is
      orthogonal to virtual content
      etc. <a href="https://crbug.com/969683">https://crbug.com/969683</a>
